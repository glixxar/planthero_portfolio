                <p> This portfolio demonstrates the development of the PlantHero project and provides details for my contribution to the project.</p>

                        The website is created with HTML, CSS and Javascript designed by me. I believe that this portfolio will demonstrate my contribution 
                        to the design process and the eventual creation of the PlantHero project. The content within each section of the website is based off  
                        the weekly journal entries that the course recommended we keep and that I have added to every week since the start of the course.

                        Future improvements to my portfolio that can be done would be making it more mobile friendly and improving its accessibility. In short,
                        the PlantHero project helped me to learn more about teamwork and expectations and this portfolio has allowed me to reflect more upon this.

                    <h2>Project: PlantHero</h1>
                    <p>
                        PlantHero is an interactive tool that makes it simple and easy to find the perfect waterwise plant for you! 
                        Waterwise plants are sturdy, resilient plants that require only 
                        minimal watering to survive. 
                        By planting waterwise plants, you are helping to fight the Australian drought crisis and can also reduce
                        your water bill at the same time.
                    </p>

                        My role in this project was coding for the website. This involved creating the main html pages for each 
                        criteria of the website and then adding the relevant css to these pages to match the design which was agreed
                        on by the team's lead designer.

                <p>Over the course of the unit, our project went through several iterations because 
                    of added and scrapped functionalities based on user feedback.

                <h3>Part A: Design Concept Proposal and Pitch   </h3>
                <h4>Product Requirements</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Design a webtool called ‘PlantHero’ that Australian amateur gardeners
                        can use to find the perfect waterwise plant to suit their living space or garden, without having to do
                        any research.</li>
                    <li>Filter user input against a <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/waterwise-plants">waterwise plants database</a> obtained from the Queensland Government</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Contributions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creation of relevant user personas to cater the website to.</li>
                    <li>Front-end UI and back-end design, creating low-fidelity testing plan.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Project Part A Reflection</h4>
                <p>
                    Part A went well as we managed to hash out the vision we have for our project. At the start, we had some worries
                    as to how we were going to implement a 2D garden for users to use to plan their garden. Eventually, the idea evolved 
                    into creating a set of prompts which gradually narrows down the options for users until they have   10 plants
                    to choose from. These points were later improved on in the latter part of the unit with the addition and removal of some 
                    prompts based on feedback from users.
                </p>
                <div id="part_A">
                    <h4>Archetypal Users</h4>
                    <p>With our users being amateur gardeners, users will utilise PlantHero to learn which waterwise plants are suitable to
                        be planted at their desired location. Most of the users will be relatively new to gardening and will be 
                        seeking a tool which mitigates the requirement to do in depth plant-suitability research prior to
                        purchasing a plant. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Building upon the target audience analysis above, I along with input from our project manager, developed three personas representing
                        who I feel will be the archetypal users of PlantHero.

                    <h4>Initial front-end design</h4>

                    </div>
                    <p>Initially, the webpage was designed as seen above with the planthero logo along with two buttons representing the find my button progressive 
                        prompt and find by name prompt. At this stage, the buttons had minimal styling without any hover effects or tooltips to indicate users have their mouse cursor 
                        over the button. The other pages also follow a very similar design style with different shades of green being used.
                    </p>

                <div class="wrapper">

                </div>
                <div class="long-border"></div>
                <h3>Part B: Creating the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)   </h3>
                <h4>MVP Progress</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The implementation of the find my plant function had been nearly completed. The 
                        series of prompts which are included are the select your future plant's location, select 
                        the type of soil, select the amount of sunlight, select the size of your plant and the select 
                        your colour preferences. The website will then match these selections against the waterwise-plants
                        dataset to provide users a small list of plants to choose from no greater than 10.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The ‘Search by name’ function was slightly appended to include the ability to search
                        by a variety of plant descriptors (such as type and colour). The page is essentially an input 
                        with a button which users can type in various attributes and names of plants to provide users 
                        with plant recommendations from the dataset.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Contributions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating html pages for each prompt in the find my plant function and styling them with the appropriate css.</li>
                    <li>Implementing an input form and its accompanying buttons for the search by description function.</li>
                    <li>Adding tooltip hover effects for buttons to guide users between webpages.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Project Part B Reflection</h4>
                <p>Through our user-testing, we managed to refine our MVP with the removal of the initial select plant attributes prompt 
                    as new amateur gardening users would be overwhelmed by the amount options they have as most of these attributes would 
                    be known to only experienced gardeners. During our demo, we had also managed to present our fully completed
                    find my plant function to receive feedback from our peers. With this, we continued to work on improving the accuracy and 
                    functionality  of the find my plant function and build on the find by description function. Together as a team we also 
                    decided to remove the 'I'm feeling lucky' function as it did not serve a distinct function on the website.
                    </p>
            <div id="part_B">
                <h4>Html Pages for the Find My Plant function</h4>
                <div class="second-flex">
                    <img class="multi-im" src="images/climate.png">
                    <img class="multi-im" src="images/soil.png">
                </div>

                <p>
                    As seen in the images, the completed prompts for the find my plant function were made with a 
                    minimalistic design with a light green background to emphasize the gardening aspect of our 
                    website. The prompts are also match the interaction plan that was drafted
                    by our lead designer Vanesssa. A simple transform effect that makes buttons bigger was added to give visual cues to
                    our users when navigating our website.
                </p>
                <h4>Input form for Search by Description</h4>
                <img class="single-img"src="images/description.png">
                <p>
                    This image shows the design of the search by description function which was partially implemented during the 
                    Part B demo and fully implemented by the Part C tradeshow. The user can type in any keywords such as 'tree', 'rose' or 
                    'cactus' or even the plant's name to bring up a list of results from the waterwise database.
                </p>
                <h4>Implementation of tooltip hover effects</h4>
                <div class="second-flex">
                    <img class="multi-im" src="images/tooltip.png">

                </div>
                <p>After several sessions of user testing, our project manager Cameron proposed to 
                    the group that we should implement tooltips to guide our users through our website. 
                    Following this, I added several useful hover effects which tell them what clicking a particular
                    button would do such as skipping a page or going back and adding the website description to the
                    logo on the main homepage.

                <li>Presented the demo portion of the tradeshow presentation for visitors.</li>
                <li>Refined the placement and design of the elements of the webpages.</li>
                <li>Assisted with the creation of the presentation slides for the demo.</li>

            <p>
                During our tradeshow, users had a great experience using our website as our website 
                was made to be easy to navigate and use. Our team also worked hard to invite our peers
                to visit our discord channel.

                There were also users who said that the website had a very homely feeling to it as
                the colour palette we used was soft and subdued. The tooltips we added also helped in 
                guiding users around the website. Several users were also keen in using our
                website to look for plants which would suit their backyard.

            <h4>Project Part C Reflection</h4>
            <p>
                Overall, I felt that our website was successful as all our visitors managed to navigate our website
                perfectly without any errors. There were some changes to the find by name and find my 
                plant function as it user testing determined that some prompts were unnecessary and the find by name
                function was modified to be search by description to make the search range more broad. Although these changes
                were necessary, it was disappointing to not be able to implement the original functionalities that were 
                decided on during Part A. 
            </p>
            <div id="part_C">
                <h4>Feedback from users on UI and Interactivity</h4>
                <p>
                    Prior to finishing the final product, we created a list of criterion for success which, if met,
                    would mean we could call the project a success.
                    This was done through user testing of the final product on 7 individuals who provided us with
                    feedback which we were able to document. The results of this was discussed in the report.
                </p>
                <h4>Website walkthrough</h4>
                <p>
                    To provide first time users guidance, an introductory walkthrough for our website
                    was added. The demonstration of the website was done by me while a quick introduction to the 
                    purpose of the website was done by Cameron, our project manager.

                <h2>Overall Course Reflection</h2>
                <h3>Meeting Expectations</h3>
                <P class="shaded-1">
                    Thinking back to my first journal entry, I feel that my original expectations were met up to a certain 
                    degree. Firstly, the expectation that I would be working on a website along with others was fulfilled as together
                    as a team we worked to create a website from scratch with different people working on different aspects of the website
                    such as design, coding and documenting. Coming together towards the end to put each person's piece of the puzzle 
                    together to produce a working and functioning website as stated in our MVP was a great experience. 
                    However, there were several difficulties which accompanied this process.  
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The course was limited from the start due to the covid-19 pandemic preventing student to student 
                    contact and relegating students and tutors to just using discord as a means of conducting classes and 
                    student interaction. As a result of this, communication was difficult and was fraught with countless 
                    issues as internet problems, microphone issues, student shyness and discord technical 
                    problems were abundant. Furthermore, discord was not inherently meant to be used
                    for education purposes. Sometimes it was just a difficult experience to listen to 
                    tutors in a channel with a hundred other students of which some forget to mute their mic or just have very bad feedback issues.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Adding to this, as the course was originally designed to be conducted face to face, several of the activities were awkward as 
                    some of the ice breakers were difficult to carry out without looking at a person's facial expressions instead relying only
                    on their voices. In general, it was better to allow students to form their teams at an earlier stage 
                    as being able to interact with our team members earlier meant that students would be able to achieve rapport and bond faster.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Over the duration of the course I felt that working together with others carries its own set of difficulties as 
                opposed to working alone as different people have different commitments and priorities. As a result, getting everyone
                to submit their part of the project was hard as their priorities may be different to mine. What I learned from this was 
                that we must be patient towards others and be firm and understanding when trying to push others to finish their part
                of their assignment. A simple message with an offer for help would go a long way in reminding group members that their part is due.

                <h3>Learning across the course</h3>
                <p>Now that the course has ended, I feel like there were a few things I managed to learn from the course. 
                </p>
                <p class="shaded">
                    The workshop sessions helped me to learn on how to apply and use php to supplement html code. The contact sessions 
                    also helped me to learn how to structure and organise when I write my report. Furthermore, I also learned the 
                    intricacies of how to build a website for users using user testing instead of building a website for developers.

                <h3>Recommendations</h3>
                <p class="shaded">
                    Allow students to form teams faster and of their own choosing as less time would be wasted on activities with students who we would not interact with after team forming.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Encourage students to pay better attention during contact sessions to ensure students are clearer on course materials.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Incorporate more individual work throughout each project part to provide students more control of their marks.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Provide sample websites for students to understand the website quality expectation.
